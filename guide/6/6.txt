6 7 > 4.2.4 Time Zone & User Profile

You will be asked for your time zone, this is pretty straightforward. Just enter your time zone.

Next Linux Mint will want you to provide the basic user information: Your Name, the Username, your computer's name and Password.

Your username is the lowercase and english alphabet version of your name.

Your computer name is composed of your username and your computer model. It is used for example in networking, and does not need to be changed usually.

I will not prescribe you how to choose your password. You should be intelligent enough to generate a secure password by yourself.

Then you can check whether you want to be logged in automatically or if you'd like to have a login screen.

If you've selected Require my password to log in, you can also choose Encrypt my home folder, which encrypts your home folder.

This is useful for a computer with multiple users. It will protect your data from being viewed from other users.
4.3: The install screen

The install screen features a progress bar, a skip button for skipping optional tasks (Note: Every task has a reason for it existing, so skipping an action may cause problems afterwards!) and a big info area.

The info area shows off the features Linux Mint offers. Also it is nice reading material for the long install time you will now have to wait through.

Above the progress bar it is said what installation action is done, and if you click on the arrow left to the text you will also see a more verbose description of what is happening.
