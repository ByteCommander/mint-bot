6 4 3 Making a bootable Medium

Basically, you have 2 Options:

    Flash a bootable USB drive

    Burn a DVD

3.1: Making a bootable Medium: Linux

If you are already running Linux, you can use Etcher for USB flashing and Brasero (or another burning software) for DVD burning.
3.1.1: Making a bootable Medium: Windows

If you are using Windows, you can use Etcher for USB flashing and the Windows Explorer for DVD burning. The Etcher process is pretty straight-forward. Once you've downloaded and ran Etcher, it shows you everything you need to do in order to create a bootable USB flash medium on both Windows and Linux
3.2: Booting the Medium
3.2.1: > Booting from USB

Depending on your BIOS configuration, the Boot Priority might prioritize your Hard Drive or DVD drive over the USB drive. In that case you're going to have to enter your Boot Menu. On most computers it is entered by pressing a key like F12 on Boot, however, depending on your model, this might differ. If everything goes right, your computer should boot into the Linux Mint Selection Screen now.
3.2.2: > Booting from CD

Many computers have the CD drive set to boot before their hard drive or USB drives. If that is not the case, you will need to enter your Boot Menu as already written in 3.2.1: > Booting from USB. If everything goes right, your computer should boot into the Linux Mint Selection Screen now.
