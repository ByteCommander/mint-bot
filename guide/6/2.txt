6 3 > 2.3: Finding out your mirror

Now that you know your architecture, click on the appropriate link.

You will be brought to a Download Section where you will find the Information about your selected edition. Now you can torrent the .iso file by clicking on Torrent. You can also download the file via HTTP.

When downloading over HTTP, just select a link of your country and the next city to you to ensure fast download speed.

For example, someone who lives in Warsaw, Poland, will get fast download speed by selecting the server of the University of Warsaw.

However, the download cannot proceed faster than the speed of your connection. So, with some images being close to 2GB in size, the download might take some time even if you selected the closest server.
> 2.4 Verifying the file

After you've downloaded the file, click on verify your ISO and select your version (in my case 19.2).

You will be linked to two files, one called sha256sum.txt and one called sha256sum.txt.gpg

Assuming you are running on Linux, just follow the instructions on the page.

If you are running on Windows, see the forum thread about verifying on Windows.

Otherwise, if you accept the risk, you may as well skip the verifying process and live with the fear of your computer being contaminated.
