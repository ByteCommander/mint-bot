1. Introduction

If you wish to install Linux Mint onto your computer, this guide will help you with that.

Linux Mint is distributed in 3 Desktop Environments, Cinnamon, MATE and XFCE.

In the End, what you install comes down to personal preference, but it must be noted that they have different levels of CPU and memory demand. Generally, Cinnamon takes more than MATE takes more than XFCE.

So, for example, a notebook with older hardware might be able to run Linux Mint Cinnamon, but that's it. As a personal note, I prefer MATE as a desktop environment over Cinnamon and XFCE, but it is up to your liking what to install.

The Desktop Environments can also be modded to change their look (Addendum A: Desktop Customization)
1.1: The 2 Versions

Linux Mint is not only distributed in 3 Desktop Environments, but also in 2 Versions: Linux Mint and LMDE.

LMDE stands for Linux Mint Debian Edition. It is currently (October 11th) only available in the Cinnamon Desktop Environment. I will, however, concentrate on the regular Linux Mint, due to it being the most popular.

This Guide might also be applicable to LMDE to some extent.
