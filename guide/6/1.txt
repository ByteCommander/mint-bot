6 2 2. Downloading Linux Mint

If you've now decided on the Desktop Environment, the next thing to check is whether you're running a 32-bit or 64-bit system.

Linux Mint is only available for x86 or amd64 systems, meaning you will not be able to install it on an Apple Computer using PowerPC as an architecture, or a Raspberry Pi for example.

If you do not know what architecture you are running, you can easily find out.
> 2.1: Finding out your Architecture (Linux)

Open a terminal and enter uname -m.

    If the output is x86_64, your system is running on 64-bits.

    If the output is i686, your system is running on 32-bits.

> 2.1:.1: Finding out your Architecture (Windows)

    Open the Windows Control Panel.

    Go to System and Security.

    Choose System.

    Find the System area, located under the Windows logo.

You should see either x86-based processor or x64-based processor.

    x86 means your processor is running on 32-bits.

    x64 means your processor is running on 64-bits.

I do not own an Apple product, so I am not able to test this. But I assume that entering uname -m into a terminal will work as well.

Anyone with an Apple product is encouraged to try it out and tell me the result.
