4 6 This small guide will teach you how to upgrade your kernel in Linux Mint.

Fire up your terminal/console of choice, and type:
sudo apt update %% sudo apt upgrade

This ensures that your system is up to date.
Next up you'll type:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:teejee2008/ppa
Hit Enter when it asks you to.
Then we'll type:
sudo apt update
This will take in the PPA we just added.
Next up we'll type:
sudo apt-get install ukuu

Now that it's installed we can close the terminal.

In your start menu type or find ukuu and click on it to open it.
Select the kernel of choice(which you want to use) and hit Install.
You will have to type your admin password again and then the program does the rest.

After it's done reboot your system and if everything went right you should have the new kernel loaded!
