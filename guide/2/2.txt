2 2 Setting an alias for certain commands can make your life a lot easier.
An alias allows you to use a specific word which you type in the console to execute a command.
Alliases are managed in ~/.bashrc.
You access this file with:
sudo nano ~/.bashrc

Inside this file you see a lot of lines, but to set an alias you add: 
alias aliasname='commands' 

An example would be:
 alias systemspecs='neofetch' 

This makes systemspecs run neofetch.
