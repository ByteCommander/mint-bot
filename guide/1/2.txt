1 2 If you trying to install an application we will say neofetch for an example. 

The command would be 

Apt install neofetch

And after you realize you forgot sudo.

Just type in sudo !!

And it will do the last command with sudo so you don't have to type it all in again :)
Also for neofetch to work you need to access the bashrc file. And at the very bottom type in 

Exec neofetch
